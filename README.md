# Scott Morales Portfolio Website

**Note:** This starter uses [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-17-gatsby-v2/).

This website is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) from **[Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms)**.

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment and CDN distribution.

## Getting Started

Feel free to clone this repository, but an easier way to set up Netlify is to use the one-click setup in the **[Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms)**.
