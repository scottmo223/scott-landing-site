# Scott Morales Portfolio Website

**Note:** This starter uses [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-17-gatsby-v2/).

I build this website in 2019 in an effort to become familiar with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org).

While I was in school I did not maintain this at all. It eventually stopped compiling in Netlify. I recently updated it to where it would compile again!
