  I created a Gatsby site for a friend using a simple starter. This time I
  decided to use a fully functioning template.

I cloned the repository for the template starter containing Netlify's headless CMS and Gatsby a few weeks ago. I first played around with using the CMS when I installed it, but haven't messed with it since then. Hence the coffee pictures. I will eventually change those pictures and make this site a portfolio to showcase my work. 

## A Short Background of My Dev Experience

I first became interested in development around the age of 13 or 14. My cousin was learning C++ in school and showed me thing or two about it. I was immediately hooked. I found an HTML book on sale at a bookstore and read through the whole thing, not really sure of what I was learning at the time. The HTML I learned proved to be useful for MySpace and a few emails, but that's about all I did with it. 

Fast forward to about a year ago, I stumbled upon that HTML book in a pile of my old junk. Remembering my excitement with C++ and my knack of HTML as a child, I started researching website development. I started to find that a lot of my friends were experience and even made a good side income building websites for clients. Digging a little further, I found that a few close friends of mine were working full time as developers in big companies and a few small start ups. 

These friends have become my mentors as I started relearning HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. That has lead me where I am today - almost halfway done with my CS degree and learning as much as I can about JavaScript as possible. 

## Picking What to Learn

I struggled with the question, "What should I be learning?" for way too long. I wasted tons of time researching, reading blogs, listening to podcasts, and worrying I might choose the wrong path to go down. Here's my advise - **JUST START CODING. **After several months of research, I finally decided to focus on  JavaScript. I took several courses on Udemy, YouTube, whatever free that I could find. Just find a tutorial and follow along. After that, Google "coding challenge" and start testing yourself. I used Code Wars to practice and it was very fun. I would try to solve it on my own for a few minutes, then I would get stuck and start researching. It never failed that I would learn something new.  Once you start learning, getting your feet wet, a few weeks in you'll get a better grasp of what to do next. What did I do?

## I Decided to Use Gatsby to Build My Friend a Website

Why did I choose Gatsby? I chose Gatsby because I wanted to learn React, and learn I did! Building the site was a fun experience, and very challenging. It helped me learn React very quickly and I felt accomplished doing my own research and figuring out how to get something to work on my own - like a real developer! To be honest I broke the code several times, but thanks to Git I was able to start over at a point before I had messed everything up. 

This site isn't pretty, and neither is the code. I am not a designer by any means. But it was my **first website EVER** and I am very proud of it. Check it out! [www.odemmissions.com](www.odemmissions.com)
