### In love with Gatsby
I stumbled upon Gatsby toward the end of 2018 and absolutely fell in love with it. I have been tinkering with it and finding websites to build with it ever since. It is truly amazing!

### Working on BS in Computer Science 
I'm halfway there. It's a long road with three kids and a full time job.

### Full time Policing
I'm currently a Police Officer working full time. I love what I do and am hopeful that one day I'll use my software knowledge to enhance Policing utilities for Officers everywhere.

### Interested in your Opportunity
I love coding, engineering, working on projects. If you have an opportunity, feel free to contact me!
